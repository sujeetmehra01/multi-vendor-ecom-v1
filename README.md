# Multi-Vendor E-Commerce Platform

A scalable and secure multi-vendor e-commerce platform built using the **MERN** stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js). This platform allows multiple vendors to manage their products and process orders while customers can browse products, make secure payments, and interact with vendors in real-time.

## Features

- **Multi-Vendor Support**: 
  - Vendors can create and manage their product listings.
  - Admin panel to manage vendors, products, and orders.

- **User Authentication**:
  - Secure login and registration with **JWT** authentication and **bcrypt** for password hashing.

- **Payment Integration**:
  - Integrated with **Stripe** and **PayPal** for payment processing.
  - Support for credit/debit card payments and PayPal transactions.

- **Real-Time Features**:
  - Real-time notifications for order updates and new product listings using **Socket.IO**.
  - Real-time live chat between vendors and customers.

- **Responsive UI**:
  - Developed using **React.js** and styled with **Material UI** and **Tailwind CSS** for a modern, mobile-first design.

- **State Management**:
  - Utilized **Redux** for managing global state across the application.

   npm install
   ```

3. Install the frontend dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in both the backend and frontend directories and add the following variables:
   - Backend `.env`:
     ```env
     MONGODB_URI=<your_mongodb_connection_string>
     JWT_SECRET=<your_jwt_secret_key>
     STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<your_stripe_secret_key>
     PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your_paypal_client_id>
     PAYPAL_SECRET=<your_paypal_secret>
     ```
   - Frontend `.env`:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_API_URL=<your_backend_url>
     REACT_APP_PAYPAL_CLIENT_ID=<your_paypal_client_id>
     REACT_APP_STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=<your_stripe_public_key>
     ```

5. Run the application:

   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm run dev
     ```

   - Start the frontend server:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm start
     ```

### Docker Setup

1. Build the Docker images for both frontend and backend:
   ```bash
   docker-compose build
   ```

2. Run the Docker containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```
